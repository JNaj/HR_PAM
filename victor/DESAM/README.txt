Matlab source code for the High Resolution analysis / synthesis of an audio signal. Its purpose is to split the signal into its sinusoidal part and its "noisy" part, i.e. the residual of the subtraction of the sinusoidal part from the original signal, see [1] for further references.

The code can be tested using the script "demo.m".

A more demonstration is available here:
